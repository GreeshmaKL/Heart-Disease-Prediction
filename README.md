# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This repository is about prediction of occurrence of heart disease using simple features. We have implemented the code in python using machine learning libraries.

The algorithms used are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Network and XGBoost. 

Logistic Regression model has the highest accuracy of 92.59% so it predicts more accurately the occurrence of heart disease compared to other algorithms.
